# Introduction
## ESG Financial (ESG)
  Expansion of the ESG Financial business domain according to Whitepaper 2.0
: Starting from Renewable Energy NFT Platform, ESG Financial has extended its 
operations to Voluntary Carbon Reduction domain.

  With its vision to become No1 Developer of the Voluntary Carbon Reduction 
oriented applications, ESG Financial is aiming to secure emission rights for 
carbon reduction produced by individuals through objective reward system.
Rather than targeting on the corporate level of a Carbon Emission Market, ESG 
Financial is seeking to develop new ecosystem, where individuals can 
contribute to Voluntary Carbon Reduction by practicing ESG in daily lives.
Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) items are minted in form of the NFT 
and can be purchased on ECO NFT Market being operated by ESG Financial. In 
newly launched Zero Quest platform ESG NFTs are available for staking with 
objective reward system encouraging users to practice ESG Life and preserve 
the environment.

  Zero Quest Web 3.0 provides to global users the ownership for the Voluntary 
Carbon Reduction data verified by IoT, Blockchain and AI
